**INSPIRATION**
We wanted to make a project that visualized the current wildfires on the west coast as well as give information about the the current state of the fires and what we can do to prevent them in the future.


**How We built it**
We used Bootstrap to Layout and design the site, and we used Mapbox for our map and visualization as well as weatherstack to get live info of the wildfires and if they are active or not.


**Challenges We ran into**
The biggest challenge we had was trying to learn react in a day, as well as implementing the live api to display data. 



**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We made an app that gives great information about the environment and what we can do to protect it, as well as information pertaining to where exactly the fire is.

**What we learned**
